The test dataset contains 10 PDB files of proteins from commonly studied plant species. We'll be using this dataset to test our TDA pipeline until groups 1 and 2 have curated the data. If you have any proteins you'd like to add to the dataset, please tell the group so we all are working with the same data.

The names of the PDB files uniquely identify each protein on the RCSB website. To locate the protein, just search for the filename on the website.

Part of our job will be to decide what information we need from each PDB file.
